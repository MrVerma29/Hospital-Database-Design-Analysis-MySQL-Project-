# Hospital-Database-Design-Analysis-MySQL-Project-
Analyzing a mockup of a hospital performance dashboard, this project focused on defining data requirements and designing an appropriate database schema to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare settings. Drawing upon domain knowledge and best practices, I designed an ERD tailored to capture relevant hospital performance metrics, including patient admissions, treatments, and outcomes. Implementing the schema in MySQL, I populated the database with simulated data and executed SQL queries to analyze hospital performance indicators. The insights derived from the analysis facilitated informed decision-making, enabling healthcare professionals to improve patient care quality and operational efficiency.
